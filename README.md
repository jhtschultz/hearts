PIMC MCTS Hearts Player
Nathan Sturtevant

This is the historical Hearts program that I developed as part of my PhD
thesis, and in subsequent years. I've extraced here the basic files needed
to compile and run players against each other with basic/reasonable settings.

This is a PIMC version of the program with MCTS at the backend. You can
easily change the rules of the game, the number of PIMC worlds, and the
number of simulations used.

The repository does not contain the full update history of the software,
but it began development in 1997-1998.
